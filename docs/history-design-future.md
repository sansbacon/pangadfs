# Inspiration and Design

I have been creating APIs with complex requirements for several years (Machine Learning, distributed systems, asynchronous jobs, NoSQL databases, etc), leading several teams of developers.

As part of that, I needed to investigate, test and use many alternatives.


## Design

Then I spent some time designing the developer "API" I wanted to have as a user (as a developer using FastAPI).

I tested several ideas in the most popular Python editors: PyCharm, VS Code, Jedi based editors.

By the last <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#development-tools" class="external-link" target="_blank">Python Developer Survey</a>, that covers about 80% of the users.

It means that **FastAPI** was specifically tested with the editors used by 80% of the Python developers. And as most of the other editors tend to work similarly, all its benefits should work for virtually all editors.

That way I could find the best ways to reduce code duplication as much as possible, to have completion everywhere, type and error checks, etc.

All in a way that provided the best development experience for all the developers.

## Future

By this point, it's already clear that **FastAPI** with its ideas is being useful for many people.

It is being chosen over previous alternatives for suiting many use cases better.

Many developers and teams already depend on **FastAPI** for their projects (including me and my team).

But still, there are many improvements and features to come.

**FastAPI** has a great future ahead.
