# Development - Contributing

The simplest way to get started with contributions is develop a plugin. Please follow the design structure of plugins such as [pangadfs-showdown](https://github.com/sansbacon/pangadfs-showdown) and [pangadfs-configapp](https://github.com/sansbacon/pangadfs-configapp).

The plugin architecture means that most feature requests should be developed through plugins, which means that no changes to pangadfs are needed to implement the feature. If you have ideas for how to improve the core pangadfs code, you can either open an issue or submit a pull request. Please format your code with yapf and use google-style docstrings. If we start to get contributions, I will develop more comprehensive guidelines, but for now these should suffice.
