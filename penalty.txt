Penalty framework

Idea is to replace optimizer rules with penalties. Penalties can be negative (bad) or positive (good).
Advantage is that it doesn't throw away reasonable options (125% ownership arbitrary) and is flexible.
Also does not require absurdly complex optimizer rules.
Disadvantage is that it takes some fiddling to get the parameters correct.


Possible penalties
* Individual ownership penalty (global or just high-owned)
* Cumulative ownership penalty (global or just high-owned)
* Diversity (too many similar lineups)
* Position combinations (QB vs DST, WR + own DST, etc.)
